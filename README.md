# To-Do-List
In today's fast-paced world, managing tasks efficiently is crucial. One way to stay organized and focused is by using a Todo List. A Todo List allows you to jot down tasks, prioritize them, and mark them as complete when finished. In this project, we will create a simple and interactive Todo List using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides the structure and layout for our web page. We will use HTML to define the basic elements of our Todo List, such as the input field, the task list, and the buttons for adding and removing tasks.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the visual appearance and styling of our Todo List. By applying CSS rules, we can customize the colors, fonts, and layout to make our Todo List visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript, a powerful scripting language, will enable us to add interactivity to our Todo List. We will use JavaScript to handle user actions, such as adding and removing tasks, updating task status, and dynamically updating the user interface.
